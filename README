# TVForMe


# TVForMe is an iOS application which acts as a hub for TV show information obtained through the 
# utilization of JSON responses from multiple APIs (mostly TVmaze and TVDb)). The application
# integrates calendar functionality to keep track of show times and makes user specific recommendations 
# for new shows to watch.

# This is an updated version of the TVFor me app, some bugs were removed from the previous version posted to git. 
# This version is still a work in progress.
